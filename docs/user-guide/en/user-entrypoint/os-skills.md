# OS Skills

OS Skills is a system management and DevOps skill library for AI Agents. It provides pre-built skills that enable Agents to perform common system administration and automation tasks.

---

## Overview

OS Skills covers three main areas:

- **System Administration** — user management, service control, package operations, filesystem tasks
- **Cloud Integration** — cloud resource queries, instance management, network configuration
- **DevOps Automation** — CI/CD pipeline management, container operations, deployment workflows

---

## Installation

```bash
anolisa install os-skills
```

---

## Quick Start

Once installed, OS Skills are available to any ANOLISA-compatible Agent runtime. The Agent can invoke skills via natural language:

```
> "Check disk usage on all mounted filesystems"
> "Restart the nginx service"
> "Show running containers and their resource usage"
```

---

## Skill Categories

### System Administration

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `disk-usage` | Check filesystem disk usage |
| `service-ctl` | Start/stop/restart system services |
| `process-mgmt` | List and manage processes |
| `user-mgmt` | User and group management |
| `package-ops` | Package install/remove/query |

### DevOps Automation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `container-ops` | Docker/Podman container management |
| `log-analysis` | Search and analyze system logs |
| `network-diag` | Network diagnostics (ping, traceroute, port check) |
| `cron-mgmt` | Cron job management |

---

## Usage with Agent Runtimes

OS Skills integrates with cosh and other ANOLISA-compatible runtimes automatically. Skills are discovered at startup and made available to the Agent's tool inventory.

```bash
# Verify skills are loaded
anolisa status os-skills
```

---

## Reading protected PDFs

Use the installed `pdf-reader` skill to extract a protected document with a known
password. Set `PDF_PASSWORD` in the invoking environment, then run:

```bash
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/read_pdf.py -f protected.pdf --password-env PDF_PASSWORD -p 1-3 --format json
```

Alternatively, use `--password PASSWORD`. The two password options are mutually
exclusive. Extraction authenticates before reading pages or metadata. A missing
or incorrect password exits nonzero and reports an error on stderr; password
values are excluded from these diagnostics.

## Configuration

Configuration file: `~/.config/os-skills/config.toml`

```toml
[skills]
# Enabled skill categories
enabled = ["system", "devops"]

[safety]
# Require confirmation for destructive operations
confirm_destructive = true
```
